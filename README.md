This paper presents a study on bank loan repayment based on Machine Learning in Finance. We built a website that contains three different options: Income prediction using census data, Bank loan repayment prediction, and Answers to Financial queries. For income prediction, we used a gradient-boosting classifier due to its higher accuracy and f1 score. For bank loan repayment prediction, we used SVM as it also has higher accuracy and an f1 score. We converted these models into a .sav file and deployed a web application using Streamlit. To answer financial queries, we used the Wikipedia API module in Python, which returns the content in Wikipedia if that page exists. We used the Wikipedia API module in Python to answer the user queries in the financial queries part of the web application.
